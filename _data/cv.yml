    - title: Ingrid Daubechies Research Assistant
      institution: Duke Unviersity
      year: 2020-now
      description:
        - Collaborate with Profossor Ingrid Daubechies and the international ARTICT team through multiple semesters of independent study, leading to journal publications and conference presentations.
          - Develop and implement algorithms to analyze and extract features from multidimensional and multimodal datasets for art analysis. In particular, data processing methods such as PCA, as well as techniques from harmonic analysis and machine learning, are used to create image processing algorithms and tools.
