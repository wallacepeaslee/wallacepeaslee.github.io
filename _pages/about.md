Hello and welcome to my webpage!

I am an applied mathematics PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge as a member of Jesus College. I currently work in the intersection of image analysis and cultural heritage under the supervision of Professor [Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/person/cbs31) as part of <a href='http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/cambridge-image-analysis'>Cambridge Image Analysis</a>. I began my PhD in 2022 and am funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

I primarily develop bespoke mathematical methods and models, using both classical approaches and AI/ML, to support the investigation of historical artworks and manuscripts. This typically involves working with heritage scientists, art historians, and conservators and using modalities such as multi/hyperspectral imaging, MA-XRF, and high-resolution photography to visualize or reconstruct particular features in a painting or manuscript, whether preliminary artist sketches or degraded writing. The projects I work on thematically relate to multi-modal image analysis, domain generalization, and visualization. For instance, I have helped shape the AI for cultural heritage hub (<a href='https://www.ai.cam.ac.uk/projects/ai-for-cultural-heritage-hub-arch.html'>ArCH</a>) and Cambridge Centre for Data-Driven Discovery (C2D3)-funded project *Non-invasive imaging and machine learning techniques for the reconstruction of degraded historical sheet music* with <a href = 'https://homepage.univie.ac.at/anna.breger/'>Anna Breger</a>. I also visited Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (the national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands) hosted by <a href='https://www.cwi.nl/en/people/tristan-van-leeuwen/'>Tristan van Leeuwen</a> and <a href='https://fgbossema.github.io/'>Francien Bossema</a> in the Computational Imaging group, working in collaboration with the Rijksmuseum.

Before my PhD, I was an undergraduate majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at Duke University. I was fortunate to begin working in applied mathematics through projects supervised by Professor [Ingrid Daubechies](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/ingrid.daubechies) (along with [Shira Faigenbaum-Golovin ](https://services.math.duke.edu/~ag617/) and [Barak Sober](https://barakino.wixsite.com/academics)) related to image processing and artworks in collaboration with the [ARTICT](https://art-ict.github.io/artict/home.html) research group and the National Gallery in London, beginning what would eventually lead to my PhD topic. I have also explored projects in pure mathematics through a senior thesis related to combinatorics and cohomology with Professor [Joseph Rabinoff](https://services.math.duke.edu/~jdr/) and a <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11446'>project</a> that started through Budapest Semesters in Mathematics with Dr. [Attila Sali](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Attila-Sali) and [Jun Yan](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/yan/).
