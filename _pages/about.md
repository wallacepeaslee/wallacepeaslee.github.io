Hello and welcome to my webpage!

I am an applied mathematics PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge as a member of Jesus College. I currently study mathematics inspired by problems from image processing and art investigation under the supervision of Provessor [Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/person/cbs31) as part of <a href='http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/cambridge-image-analysis'>Cambridge Image Analysis</a>. I began my PhD in 2022 and am funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

Before my PhD, I was an undergraduate majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at Duke University. I was fortunate to begin working in applied mathematics through projects supervised by Professor [Ingrid Daubechies](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/ingrid.daubechies) (along with [Shira Faigenbaum-Golovin ](https://services.math.duke.edu/~ag617/) and [Barak Sober](https://barakino.wixsite.com/academics)) related to image processing and artworks in collaboration with the [ARTICT](https://art-ict.github.io/artict/home.html) research group, beginning what would eventually lead to my PhD topic. I have also explored projects in pure mathematics through a senior thesis related to combinatorics and cohomology with Professor [Joseph Rabinoff](https://services.math.duke.edu/~jdr/) and a <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11446'>project</a> that started through Budapest Semesters in Mathematics with Dr. [Attila Sali](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Attila-Sali) and [Jun Yan](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/yan/).
