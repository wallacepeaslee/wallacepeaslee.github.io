Hello and welcome to my webpage!

I am a mathematics PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge as a member of Jesus College. I currently study mathematics inspired by problems from image processing and art investigation under the supervision of Provessor [Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/cbs31/Home.html). I began my PhD in 2022 and am funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

Before my PhD, I was an undergraduate majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at Duke University. I was priveledged to work with Professor [Ingrid Daubechies](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/ingrid.daubechies), where I began working on mathematics for image processing in collaboration with the [ARTICT](https://art-ict.github.io/artict/home.html) research group. This sparked my interest in the area of mathematics I currently study. While at Duke, I also explored projects in pure mathematics by publishing a senior thesis related to combinatorics and cohomology with Professor [Joseph Rabinoff](https://services.math.duke.edu/~jdr/) and by an ongoing project that started through Budapest Semesters in Mathematics with Dr. [Attila Sali](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Attila-Sali).
